Overview

Objective

The goal of Quiz Master - V1 is to create a lightweight, interactive system for quiz-based learning and performance monitoring. It is intended for both academic and professional users who want to assess their knowledge in a structured, subject-wise manner.

Problem Solved

Conventional quiz systems lack interactivity, are difficult to administer, and donâ€™t track performance effectively. This project solves these limitations by enabling:
- Easy quiz creation and management
- Time-bound tests
- Automated performance visualization
- Multi-role access for users and admins
